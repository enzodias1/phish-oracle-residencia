<p>In a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/12EPgVaInl3eH6M4nY6Jje" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent episode of the <em>Deconstructor of Fun</em> podcast</a>, I sat down with Michail Katkoff to explore a topic close to my heart: how engagement mechanics typically associated with gaming are finding their way into non-gaming, consumer apps.<br><br>Here’s a summary of the standout apps we’ve looked at, including Duolingo, BeReal, Tinder, DraftKings, and Crypto.com. I walk through what they can teach us about building stickier, smarter apps.</p>



<p></p>



<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the engagement strategies of top apps, I invite you to <a href="https://liftoff.io/intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about AppRefinery</a>. We analyze mobile apps at the feature level, helping companies understand how top apps leverage innovative designs and LiveOps techniques to engage, retain, and monetize users across multiple app verticals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>Duolingo: AI-Led Engagement Designed for Retention</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Duolingo is recognized as a leader in gamifying education. Their creative, winning approaches to encouraging user engagement are well known. But what makes the app stand out today is its use of AI to expand engagement and monetization, particularly through its top-tier subscription, <strong>Duolingo Max</strong>.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">In particular, our analysts at AppRefinery noted these premium features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Roleplay Mode</strong>: Interactive, AI-powered conversations that simulate real-life scenarios. Input is scored based on vocabulary richness.</li>



<li><strong>Explain My Answer</strong>: An AI tutor breaks down mistakes on the fly.</li>



<li><strong>Video Call Lessons</strong>: Adds a synchronous, social element to practice.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">These features are gated behind Duolingo Max, indicating the app’s willingness to provide a premium experience for a premium fee.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="568" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x568.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35192" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x568.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-300x167.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1536x852.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-72x40.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-900x500.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1128x626.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-564x313.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-375x208.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A closer look at Duolingo’s features on the AppRefinery platform</em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Crucially, Duolingo has transformed practice into app performance, offering features closer to gaming sessions than language drills. In addition, the point gains are tied to progressing through levels. This way, the app builds a retention engine based on interaction rather than repetition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>BeReal: Balancing Engagement and Authenticity</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Originally designed as the &#8220;anti-Instagram,&#8221; BeReal gained traction with a prompt for simultaneous photo posting. Their value proposition has always been clear: one post daily, no filters, no feed-scrolling, and no influencers. However, after its acquisition by Voodoo, the platform has pivoted to introduce additions that look a lot like features from other popular social apps. The additions include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Verified brands and influencers</strong> with follower mechanics.</li>



<li><strong>Nearby Feed</strong> for passive content consumption.</li>



<li><strong>Friends of Friends</strong> visibility expansion.</li>



<li><strong>Group Chats</strong> with their own daily “Time to BeReal” prompts.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">At this stage, these changes create friction between BeReal&#8217;s minimalist design (its core value) and the best-practice features in mainstream social platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="567" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1024x567.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35193" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1024x567.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-300x166.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1536x851.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-72x40.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-900x498.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1128x625.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-564x312.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-375x208.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Breaking down BeReal’s features on the AppRefinery platform</em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Whether it’s too little, too late—or too much, too soon—is an open question, but the tension between maintaining distinctiveness and chasing engagement is front and center. We’ll be interested in following up on how the new features are received.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>Tinder: Taking Dating Beyond Swipes With Limited-Time Events</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Tinder is rethinking what dating apps can be by taking inspiration from LiveOps strategies from mobile games. Instead of constant loops of swipes, matches, and messaging, they’ve leaned into <strong>seasonal and reactive events</strong> that create short bursts of high engagement.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Examples include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Swipe Night</strong>: A story-driven narrative experience with decision trees that influence post-event matchmaking.</li>



<li><strong>Vibes</strong>: Timed Q&amp;A prompts that appear on user profiles to spark conversations.</li>



<li><strong>The Game Game</strong>: An AI-led conversation coach that gamifies flirtation.</li>



<li><strong>Swipe Surge</strong>: Notifies users when local activity spikes, increasing odds of matching.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">These events offer alternative engagement paths beyond the usual swiping and chatting. They&#8217;re also highly geo-targeted, which allows Tinder to fine-tune campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-1024x570.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35194" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-1024x570.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-300x167.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-1536x854.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-72x40.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-900x501.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-1128x627.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-564x314.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4-375x209.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-4.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Tinder’s event strategy on the AppRefinery platform</em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Compared to competitors like Bumble, which primarily stick to static formats, Tinder&#8217;s events strategy introduces novelty, urgency, and shared context—a rare combination in this space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>DraftKings: Turning Sports Betting Into a Social Experience</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Surprisingly, many sportsbook apps still treat betting as a solitary, transactional task. DraftKings is shifting that model by embedding community and competition into its core. The features include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Bet Feed</strong>: A social stream of real-time wagers that users can like, comment on, and replicate.</li>



<li><strong>Betting Groups</strong>: Guild-style communities with shared picks, chat, and group engagement.</li>



<li><strong>Pools</strong>: Social prediction contests—often free to enter—that reward leaderboard positioning.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">This playbook turns betting into a visible, communal activity. It brings the experience closer to watching a game in a bar with friends rather than checking odds alone. More importantly, it creates daily return reasons even on non-betting days, building repeat behavior through visibility and light competition.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="568" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-1024x568.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35195" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-1024x568.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-300x166.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-1536x852.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-72x40.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-900x499.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-1128x625.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-564x313.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-375x208.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>DraftKings’ top features side-by-side on the AppRefinery platform</em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">AppRefinery offers a closer look at how DraftKings structures these systems—and where others in the category are falling short.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>Crypto.com: Missions, Streaks, and Tokenized Rewards</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Crypto.com, originally a utility platform for buying and trading crypto, now incorporates high-impact engagement systems to encourage daily activity. We’ve seen them blend engagement with its token economy in a way closer to mobile games than traditional fintech.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Engagement systems include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Daily Missions and Onboarding Tasks</strong>: Rewarded with in-app “diamond” currency.</li>



<li><strong>Badges and Achievement Tiers</strong>: Progression visuals that add status to transactional activity.</li>



<li><strong>Streak Bonuses</strong>: Light-touch re-engagement mechanics for daily check-ins.</li>



<li><strong>Diamond Store</strong>: A dedicated redemption hub for merch, subscriptions, and even mystery boxes with randomized token payouts.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Because Crypto.com can reward with its token (Cronos), it creates a closed loop where in-app behavior directly translates to value.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="567" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-1024x567.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35196" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-1024x567.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-300x166.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-1536x851.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-72x40.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-900x498.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-1128x625.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-564x312.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6-375x208.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-6.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Overview of Crypto.com’s features on the AppRefinery platform</em></figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">This strategy encourages usage on quiet market days and positions the app as a trading tool and a finance product that users are meant to “play with.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">If there’s one takeaway from these five case studies, it’s this: mechanisms once exclusive to games are becoming table stakes for top-performing non-gaming apps. Whether it’s Duolingo reinventing learning with AI, Tinder creating urgency through timed content, or DraftKings embedding social behaviors into betting, we’re seeing intentional design choices driving real results.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">At AppRefinery, we map these systems feature by feature across categories to help teams benchmark against the most effective strategies in the market. In today’s app economy, differentiation doesn’t just come from attention-grabbing features—it comes from building systems that give users more reasons to return.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">We’ve been running the Mobile Gamedev Awards for a few years at GameRefinery, but you may have noticed that this year, we decided it was time for a new name: the Mobile Appdev Awards. Why the change? With the launch of AppRefinery, <a target="_blank" href="https://liftoff.cn/blog/introducing-apprefinery-for-consumer-app-insights/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liftoff’s Exclusive Platform for Consumer App Insights</a>, we wanted to spotlight the industry-changing innovations we were seeing in consumer apps. After all, mobile apps and games can learn a lot from each other&#8217;s achievements.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Our app awards focused on four categories: Best Feature Innovation, Best Use of Engagement Features, Excellence in Social Features, and Excellence in AI-Powered Features. You can see the complete list of winners and nominees <a target="_blank" href="https://info.liftoff.io/2025-mobile-appdev-awards" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Below, we take a closer look at this year’s winners and some key takeaways for both gaming and non-gaming app developers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Best Feature Innovation: DraftKings</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="716" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings.png" alt="DraftKings" class="wp-image-35219" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings-300x215.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings-72x52.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings-900x644.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings-564x404.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DraftKings-375x269.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DraftKings</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Best Feature Innovation recognizes features that provide an exceptional user experience and push the boundaries of what users can expect from the app’s core functionality. The award went to DraftKings, one of the biggest sports betting platforms in the world, for its highly informative Stats Hub.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The Stats Hub does exactly what it says, providing users with data and statistics to help them make more nuanced betting predictions. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Line Moves:</strong> Changes in betting odds or point spreads that occur as money comes in. They often occur due to spikes in betting behaviour, or due to changes in weather or injuries. Dedicated bettors track them to spot good opportunities as soon as they appear.</li>



<li><strong>Consistency Sheets:</strong> Analytics that track how reliably a player performs against certain statistical thresholds or fantasy point targets. They help identify players who consistently score above a certain fantasy point value, which is crucial for games where stable performance is key.</li>



<li><strong>Systems &amp; Streaks:</strong> Systems are predefined rules for betting or building DFS (daily fantasy sports) lineups, and streaks are patterns of consistently good or bad performance. Bettors might follow a system (e.g., betting on underdogs after a loss) or seek out teams/players on a winning or losing streak.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From DraftKings’s Stats Hub</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Even if you’re unfamiliar with sports betting apps, it’s easy to appreciate why this would be an essential feature. Most iGaming apps do not offer similarly extensive stats features. It’s an excellent example of a developer looking at the market, seeing an audience need that isn’t being addressed, and seizing the opportunity to build a high-impact feature.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Best Use of Engagement Features: <a target="_blank" href="http://trip.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a></p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">Next up is the award for Best Use of Engagement Features, which spotlights apps that keep users coming back with compelling retention mechanics, personalized journeys, and inventive engagement strategies. This time around, the award went to the travel/booking app <a target="_blank" href="http://trip.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a> for its AI-powered travel assistant, the Trip Genie.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Anyone who has booked a holiday will know it’s a multi-step process. Where do you fly from? Where will you be staying? Do I need to book tickets for museums and other attractions? Are there any special regulations or legal forms I must fill out for my destination?&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The Trip Genie is designed to lead users through the process.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The Trip Genie is built directly into <a target="_blank" href="http://trip.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a> as a purpose-built assistant, meaning you can ask for a helping hand anytime. It’s not on a third-party site, so it offers users a much more streamlined experience. For example, if the Genie suggests you stay in a specific hotel during your trip, you only have to accept the suggestion to initiate booking. For example, if you were doing this through ChatGPT, you’d be directed to a third-party site and prompted to create an account. Unifying the process on one platform is much more convenient and prevents churn.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From <a target="_blank" href="http://trip.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a>’s Trip Genie</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">AI assistants are becoming more common, but only a handful of apps or websites have truly helpful agents that improve user engagement. In time, we suspect that more travel apps will implement this feature, but by being one of the first, many users will see <a target="_blank" href="http://trip.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a> as ahead of the curve. With the right features, users are more likely to stick around to see other advanced features come down the line.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Excellence in Social Features: Snapchat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="929" height="1000" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35221" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat.png 929w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-279x300.png 279w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-61x66.png 61w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-300x323.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-900x969.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-564x607.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Snapchat-375x404.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snapchat</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For gaming and non-gaming apps, social features can be powerful tools for boosting engagement. Encouraging users to interact with one another and share their experiences can make the app experience more enjoyable, providing a tangible reason to keep coming back. However, the best demonstration of social features our analysts encountered was Snapchat’s Snap Map.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Snapchat has evolved to become so much more than just a messaging service. With the Snap Map, users can create digital personas in a virtual world, complete with a customizable home. The Snap Map isn’t a new feature—in fact, it’s been around for a while as a utility feature used to share your location with friends and family. However, the ability to show off your personality is a relatively new but welcome addition that adds self-expression to connecting with others.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways from Snapchat’s Snap Map</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Sometimes, developers hesitate to implement new features because they’re worried about the return on investment if the features aren’t a hit. However, Snapchat proves that innovation doesn’t require developing from scratch. Instead of building an entirely new feature, they identified opportunities to enhance an existing winner. It’s a strategy we think most apps can benefit from.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Excellence in AI-Powered Features: Pinterest</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="716" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest.png" alt="Pinterest" class="wp-image-35222" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest-300x215.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest-72x52.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest-900x644.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest-564x404.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pinterest-375x269.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pinterest</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Generative AI is everywhere—especially in mobile. Mobile app developers are leveraging AI to enhance user experience in truly transformative ways. One example is Pinterest, for which we awarded our Excellence in AI-Powered Features award.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Pinterest’s use of generative AI isn’t limited to one feature. In fact, it’s impressive how neatly AI features are implemented across the user journey to improve the overall experience:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Custom Backgrounds:</strong> Pinterest AI users can now generate custom backgrounds for their product images. If you have a plain photo of a chair or something you are trying to sell, the AI can place it in a beautifully decorated room for you.</li>



<li><strong>Recommendations: </strong>Pinterest also added personalized content recommendations. The app learns your tastes and can better tailor your home feed to suit your likes and dislikes.</li>



<li><strong>Collage Generator:</strong> Pinterest introduced creative tools like an AI-assisted collage generator that helps users mash up these different pins to create stylish vision boards. Some reports by Pinterest have shown that these AI-generated collages have tripled user engagement.</li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From Pinterest’s AI Features</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Gen AI has a wide range of use cases. If you’re struggling to think of meaningful ways to implement the technology as a new feature, you might be better served by looking at how it can enhance your existing user experience. Sometimes, minor but meaningful enhancements can be highly impactful.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">2025 has already been an exceptional year for mobile games. Game developers have pulled out all the stops this year to thrill their user base. So when we selected the winners of our Appdev Awards, we had our choice of eye-catching, top-performing games.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">This year, we recognize midcore and casual mobile games in five categories: Best Collaboration Event, Best Social Event, Best Minigame, Best Newcomer, and Biggest Evolver. You can see the complete list of winners and nominees <a target="_blank" href="https://info.liftoff.io/2025-mobile-appdev-awards" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. But to provide more context, we wanted to give an account of why we selected our winners and, more importantly, the lessons other game developers can learn from their accomplishments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Best Collaboration Event: Diablo Immortal x World of Warcraft</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="695" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo.png" alt="World of Warcraft’s Lich King in Diablo: Immortal
" class="wp-image-35211" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo-300x209.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo-72x50.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo-900x626.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo-564x392.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lich-King-in-Diablo-375x261.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">World of Warcraft’s Lich King in Diablo: Immortal</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Crossovers are increasingly common among the best-performing mobile games. Many franchises have already appeared in multiple games, including Transformers, Snoopy, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Evangelion—we could go on and on. But every year, a few titles do something special with their collaborations, taking the best elements of a franchise to provide players with a truly memorable experience.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">At our AppDev Awards, we recognized titles that did this well, including <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?__hsfp=1639998370&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;additionalDatas=gameVersion,topIAPs,revenueChange,downloadChange,auChange,analystReview&amp;dateFrom=1730325600000&amp;dateTo=1731621599999&amp;feedDateFrom=1731448800000&amp;feedDateTo=1731621599999&amp;gameIds=62984563b5b5a43e49571806&amp;m_liveEventId=673490f1ffdec41c77d3f738&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=6641d936b525066dd418a7d4&amp;m_tab=Description&amp;m_trackedGameId=62984563b5b5a43e49571806&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;performanceChangesBy=Impact_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.1&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo Immortal’s crossover with World of Warcraft</a>. From the outset, this was likely to be a strong pairing because the same developer, Activision-Blizzard, helms the two properties. Diablo Immortal players were likely to be familiar with World of Warcraft, at least in some capacity.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Titled Eternal War, the event series had a lot to offer, especially considering it was Diablo Immortal’s first large-scale collaboration. Players collected Frozen Boons from special events such as special WoW-themed limited-time modes, unlocking exclusive rewards. The modes were impressive, with exceptionally high production values and a strong appreciation for World of Warcraft as an IP.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For example, one of the events that staged one of the most famous moments in the MMORPG was the battle against the Lich King. These events were based on existing limited-time modes, but the aesthetic redesign made them feel new. Players could also earn a vast assortment of cosmetic rewards based on World of Warcraft’s 20th Anniversary, which generated a lot of positive sentiment across the user base.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From the Diablo Immortal and World of Warcraft Crossover</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Usually, collaboration events introduce a franchise to bring something entirely new to a game. The PUBG Mobile x Venom: The Last Dance or Brawl Stars x SpongeBob SquarePants, for example, introduce freshness without making substantial changes to the gameplay.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">By contrast, Diablo and World of Warcraft successfully combined two similar properties by offering varied and enjoyable gameplay combined with a strong appreciation for the World of Warcraft IP. The successful collaboration depended, in no small part, on strong backing from Activision-Blizzard.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The main lesson here mainly applies to publishers with a strong portfolio of IP—bringing your many franchises together can pay dividends when done correctly. As a bonus, you can also use this as a testing ground to see how players might react to a full-fledged mobile installment of a video game franchise available only on PC and/or console.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Best Social Event: League of Legends: Wild Rift – Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="695" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities.png" alt="League of Legends: Wild Rift - Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities
" class="wp-image-35212" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities-300x209.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities-72x50.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities-900x626.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities-564x392.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Battle-of-Twin-Cities-375x261.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">League of Legends: Wild Rift &#8211; Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Social events have proven to be one of the most effective ways to drive engagement on mobile, but that’s hardly surprising. After all, what could be better for keeping players interested than encouraging them to play along with their friends? But the standout social event for this year, at least on the midcore market, was <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CanalystReview&amp;dateFrom=1730325600000&amp;dateTo=1731621599999&amp;feedDateFrom=1731448800000&amp;feedDateTo=1731621599999&amp;gameIds=5f9969ae96f1b100c54bb339&amp;performanceChangesBy=Impact_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.1&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=5f9969ae96f1b100c54bb339&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=63c549ffd932b600af92a0f8&amp;m_liveEventId=672cba51457f2b198395d15c&amp;m_tab=Description&amp;__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hsfp=1639998370" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends: Wild Rift &#8211; Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities</a>.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The event was a collaboration too. It was similar in approach to the Diablo Immortal event in that it was a closely related crossover. The collaboration featured Arcane, timed to support the launch of season two of the incredibly popular League of Legends TV series. The series took the top spot on Netflix’s most popular charts in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-tops-netflix-most-popular-charts-in-60-countries" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 60 countries in November</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As the name suggests, the event revolves around two warring cities, Zaun and Piltover—the same overarching narrative thread of Arcane’s second season. Players chose to align with a city and then had to cooperate with their Zaun or Piltover comrades to complete various tasks, such as Arcane-themed quizzes.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The faction would capture more territories on the event’s world map as it progressed, and the side that controls the most territories at the end of the event was crowned the winner. Winning members received a bonus exclusive Zaun or Piltover-themed profile icon, in addition to the rewards accessible for all players regardless of faction. That blend of social and competitive elements was powerful. They tapped into multiple player motivations and rode the hype around the highly acclaimed series effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From League of Legends: Wild Rift &#8211; Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">It’s no secret that many mobile games encourage players to become part of guilds or factions. When players join these thriving, established communities, they are more likely to remain engaged. They’re not only enjoying playing the game, they’re given a chance to support others and work toward bigger, better rewards.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">However, the one drawback to guilds is that they can be intimidating, especially for newer players. Some games have hundreds, if not thousands, of guilds, and choosing the one that’s right for you can be a bit of a learning curve. For example, there’s a strong chance you might end up in a guild that just isn’t your style, or more frustratingly, one that’s right for you but on the cusp of disbanding, leaving you back at square one.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The League of Legends: Wild Rift &#8211; Arcane: Battle of Twin Cities event took the benefits of guild-based events and applied them to the entire Wild Rift player base. Everyone could join in, regardless of their experience level or existing guild commitments. This enhanced the event’s appeal and helped guarantee its overall success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Best Minigame: Merge Mansion – Secret Supply</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="716" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply.png" alt="Merge Mansion - Secret Supply" class="wp-image-35213" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply-300x215.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply-72x52.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply-900x644.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply-564x404.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Merge-Mansion-Secret-Supply-375x269.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Merge Mansion &#8211; Secret Supply</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Games within games have existed for almost as long as video games have, but this concept has come into its own over the past decade. On PC and consoles, some minigames have become so popular that they’ve spawned standalone titles, such as in the case of The Witcher 3’s Gwent. On mobile, minigames have also proven incredibly effective, providing ways to introduce all-new gameplay ideas and experiences without disrupting the core gameplay.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">A standout example of mobile minigames in action is <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker?__hsfp=1639998370&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;additionalDatas=gameVersion,topIAPs,revenueChange,downloadChange,auChange&amp;dateFrom=1730325600000&amp;dateTo=1731621599999&amp;feedDateFrom=1699999200000&amp;feedDateTo=1731621599999&amp;gameIds=565c92d79b75634154f21812,565c92e09b75634154f2188a,565c92e59b75634154f218de,565c92fe9b75634154f21a60,565c92ff9b75634154f21a6e,566e5b0bbc85fa044a929e9f,57c0b378bc85fa29538b4fdd,588659fdbc85faa3cff61d84,593c82317879290b157c49f8,597b427f7879294b2581b349,59ca08fb787929a4ec898719,59ca166d787929a4ec8991e0,59d744ddd869971487e36567,59e88142787929b6e35fa6fa,5a698fb9e84ef54725863a7d,5aeafa199890a26033056ac9,5c592c9d9890a2235f75963f,5d3c57459890a21ef4d201d7,5d6918c09890a278b84b9167,5ef5fb919890a21714302883,5f1c2b699890a24fa48e8870,5fe32d9c9890a23f386e0800,60df742d522c25d227e95b33,62ad7a1a5e1d89dba0d90d05,633f394391174c09953ffab5,6393a7d40ac8cb3fb1fd1717,64f1c47dfd491a4840f2a867&amp;liveEventAppearances=New&amp;liveEventTags=634fd1bef651c500a9756053,635a413ff651c500a971952b,635a4118f651c500a971952a&amp;m_liveEventId=6637e3b6ae31786b127d218e&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fd1bef651c500a9756053&amp;m_tab=Description&amp;m_trackedGameId=5ef5fb919890a21714302883&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;performanceChangesBy=Impact_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.1&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Merge Mansion’s Secret Supply</a>, our Best Minigame for the casual market. The event introduced a casino-style arcade machine where players pulled a lever to generate mergeable items, carefully managing limited energy to maximize the score before the machine overheated.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The event is aggressively monetized, requiring players to purchase premium currency to continue. The game’s revenue performance reflects that, as it often spikes whenever this event is active (typically around once every other week).</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">This event is such a success story because it’s a dramatically different experience from the main game. Usually, Merge Mansion is relatively slow and relaxing, whereas this minigame had you pull the “machine” repeatedly like you’re in an actual casino. The event is so successful that Merge Mansion’s competitor, Gossip Harbor, released its own version of the event, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?__hsfp=1639998370&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange&amp;dateFrom=1730325600000&amp;dateTo=1731621599999&amp;feedDateFrom=1699999200000&amp;feedDateTo=1731621599999&amp;gameIds=62ad7a1a5e1d89dba0d90d05&amp;liveEventAppearances=New&amp;performanceChangesBy=Impact_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.1&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=62ad7a1a5e1d89dba0d90d05&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fd1bef651c500a9756053&amp;m_liveEventId=66faa7f800b831700ffd659c&amp;m_tab=Description" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Drop Rush</a>.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways from Merge Mansion’s Secret Supply</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Merge Mansion’s minigame highlights the power of hybridization: introducing gameplay elements from a genre different from your own. Merge Mansion players are accustomed to a more laid-back gameplay experience, so throwing them into the social casino genre is a significant change of pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">While that might risk alienating some of the user base, it generally works because players don’t have to engage any more or less than they want to because this is a minigame. If they love it, they can jump in whenever the event pops up in the rotation and even invest in premium currency to make the most of its active period. If they find it too much, they can ignore it entirely, or just play around for small intervals when they want a change of pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Best Newcomer: Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="718" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket.png" alt="Pokémon TCG Pocket" class="wp-image-35214" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket.png 1000w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-300x215.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-72x52.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-900x646.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-564x405.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-375x269.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pokémon TCG Pocket</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Thousands of new mobile games enter the market daily, but one title stood out: <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/game/66f656345307fa4feb62afa5/overview?__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hsfp=1639998370" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. While it didn’t quite manage to exceed the monumental impact of Pokémon GO’s launch in 2016, where hordes of players could be seen parading through the streets, the game made many headlines when it launched towards the end of October last year. It <a target="_blank" href="https://maf.ad/en/blog/pokemon-tcg-pocket-strategies-launch/" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned $33.7 million in its first week</a> and hit the $100 million milestone after just 17 days on the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">More impressively, it&#8217;s largely maintained its performance in the following months, with an average sustained gross rank of seven in the US and two in Japan. We have a few different theories about why the game has proven to be such a hit. For one, Pokémon already has a colossal following as a real-life trading card game, but despite numerous attempts, it hasn’t been able to replicate that success in video game form—until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">TCG Pocket differs from past attempts because it revolves around collecting rather than focusing on actual battles. That’s a good fit for mobile as a platform. It’s easy for casual players to engage with: they log in for a few quick sessions a day to open up some card packs, get a surge of nostalgia, and continue to go about their routine. It also aligns well with the IP as a whole—Pokémon’s catchphrase is literally “gotta catch ‘em all”.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">TCG Pocket also caters to more advanced players who want to focus on battling or are curious to learn more about it. The actual mechanics of this are much simpler than the real-world version of the Pokémon TCG game, which has been around for so long that it isn’t very approachable for newcomers. One could almost argue it’s like an expanded tutorial that builds your confidence enough to jump into the physical game, should you want to.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways from Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For most mobile games, in-app purchases are an add-on to the user experience—whether it’s extra in-game resources that give players an edge in battle or flashy skins that will impress other players. However, few mobile games manage to embed monetization into the core experience in the same way that TCG Pocket does—especially without alienating freemium players.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Simply put, people play TCG pocket because they enjoy collecting Pokémon cards. And if they want to open more packs and get extra cards, they need to spend six PokéGold, which costs around $1.20. That’s a fairly reasonable outlay, so much so that the game has a limit to stop certain players from buying too many card packs, too soon (720 PokéGold per day).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Biggest Evolver: Brawl Stars</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="532" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars.png" alt="Brawl Stars" class="wp-image-35215" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars.png 800w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars-300x200.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars-72x48.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars-564x375.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brawl-Stars-375x249.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brawl Stars</figcaption></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Let’s move from new games to the seasoned veterans. Countless titles have been on the mobile market for years, adapting to changing market conditions and evolving to meet the needs of their user base. Some mobile games even go so far as to turn themselves from moderate success stories into absolute chart toppers, and one such particular example really surprised our team over the past year.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">When Supercell’s <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/game/594283f3787929e3bb5367a9/overview?__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hsfp=1639998370" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brawl Stars</a> first launched in 2018, it was reasonably successful. Still, the game struggled to maintain that momentum in the following years. Between 2022 and 2023, Brawl Stars saw a significant decline in performance, and questions lingered over how they could turn things around. Thankfully, after releasing some enjoyable new content and well-thought-out updates, Supercell managed not just to revive the game but push it to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">But how did they do it? There were numerous changes in Brawl Stars, but three truly hit the mark. First, Brawl Stars launched large-scale collaboration events, partnering with <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?__hsfp=1639998370&amp;__hssc=241307293.2.1752151143669&amp;__hstc=241307293.a2f6393d41efdbe3f64de5ed561395b3.1747653415948.1751901095343.1752135449270.30&amp;additionalDatas=gameVersion,topIAPs,revenueChange,downloadChange,auChange,analystReview&amp;dateFrom=1728853200000&amp;dateTo=1730152799999&amp;feedDateFrom=1729976400000&amp;feedDateTo=1730152799999&amp;gameIds=594283f3787929e3bb5367a9&amp;m_liveEventId=66d9a39802c1b17106642985&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=6641d936b525066dd418a7d4&amp;m_tab=Description&amp;m_trackedGameId=594283f3787929e3bb5367a9&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;performanceChangesBy=Impact_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.1&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved franchises like SpongeBob SquarePants</a>, Toy Story, and Godzilla, which helped encourage lapsed players to return to the experience. While these collaborations weren’t the first Brawl Stars ever launched—the game had previously released skins based on the likes of Paris Saint-Germain soccer team and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bt21.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">BT21</a>—it was the first time the game had launched events based entirely on a recognized IP.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Second, Brawl Stars made several clever tweaks to its gameplay systems at the beginning of 2024. These included a new linear progression system called <a target="_blank" href="https://saas.gamerefinery.com/#/game/view/594283f3787929e3bb5367a9/updatehistory/?gameUpdateModal=1229016807,47.190,us&amp;shotModal=639758b4d1f60500afae0e4d,639758b4d1f60500afae0e4e&amp;shotModalIso=us" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starr Road,</a> which enables players to unlock new characters and upgrades using credits. They also introduced the ability to hypercharge characters, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/game/594283f3787929e3bb5367a9/updatehistory/gameupdate/594283f3787929e3bb5367a9/53.166/us" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked the game’s battle pass</a>, and implemented a more streamlined ranked mode to better appeal to competitive players.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Finally, Supercell also enhanced its live events by introducing limited-time boosts and skills for characters. For example, the Angels and Demons event introduced limited-time boosts that added a layer of progression during the event and resulted in the game’s biggest daily revenue spike in its entire lifetime.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Takeaways From Brawl Stars</strong></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Brawl Stars offers a powerful masterclass on sustaining and reigniting user engagement for any mobile game developer—even those working with an established title. It&#8217;s a testament to the fact that even ageing titles can survive and genuinely thrive by being proactive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Keeping up with the latest monetization trends in mobile gaming can be challenging. The landscape is constantly evolving, with new monetization methods, challenges, and innovations constantly popping up.</p>
<p>If you want to know what the biggest monetization trends are right now, look no further than episode 62 of Liftoff’s Mobile Games Playbook. In the episode, host Jon Jordan speaks to experts Andrew Seow, formerly Director of Monetization at Tripledot Studios, and Ravid Sela, Ad Monetization Lead at Playstudios.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we summarize some of their insights, including thoughts about the move towards header bidding and its impact on the industry, the rise of hybrid monetization models, and potential future innovation in mobile app monetization.</p>
<h2>The rise of header bidding in mobile app monetization</h2>
<p>In 2024, the rise of Header Bidding was a standout monetization trend in mobile gaming, headlined by Google Ads, with other networks like Moloco following suit and making that transition as well.</p>
<p>Header bidding is a process where mobile app publishers offer their ad inventory to multiple advertising networks simultaneously, allowing them to bid on it simultaneously. This creates more competition for each ad impression, increasing revenue for the app publisher by ensuring they receive the best possible price.</p>
<p>Seow describes header bidding as similar to a single-slot auction house, where bidders offer their bids side-by-side instead of offering competing bids, one after the other. </p>
<p>Header bidding differs from the alternative ‘waterfall model’, a programmatic approach in which ad requests are sent sequentially to ad networks in order of their historical performance until one fills the ad slot.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of header bidding</h3>
<p>The shift towards header bidding has changed the pricing dynamic from publisher-led to more partner or network-led. This change has pros and cons when compared to the waterfall model.</p>
<p>Header bidding cuts out much of the work involved in methods like the waterfall model, giving the mediator more power. Due to the process’s concealed algorithm, more agency is given to the bidders, and publishers may lose access to the information they would gain from seeing which rates are not succeeding in the bidding process and the eCPMs of losing bids.</p>
<p>While workflow is improving, valuable intel can be lost in the process. Another disadvantage is that not everyone can benefit from such a streamlined, large-scale system.</p>
<p>Seow says: “We need to remember that on the other side of the chain are individual advertisers who want to buy inventory on our apps, and they can only do that if they have the technical ability to read the signals they are sending, interpret them, and price them. Changing bidding has streamlined a lot of infrastructure, but it isn’t necessarily accessible to all advertisers.”</p>
<h2>Monetization trends and challenges in 2024</h2>
<p>It is widely accepted that 2024 was not a strong year across the monetization industry. Two key reasons for weaker performance were greater control for networks and mediation partners, and the increased user acquisition costs. Strategies have had to evolve, so publishers have found new tactics to adapt to a shifting ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Hybrid monetization models</h3>
<p>In 2024, hybrid monetization models became increasingly popular among mobile game publishers. These models combine in-app advertising and in-app purchases to maximize overall revenue streams and user engagement. Games can cater to a broader audience, engaging players who prefer not to spend upfront through rewarded video ads while also offering opportunities for paying users to enhance their experience. </p>
<p>Hybrid monetization is effective because it can attract a wider user base through accessible ad-supported options while simultaneously benefiting from higher eCPMs driven by paying users within the app, creating a self-reinforcing cycle for revenue generation.</p>
<p>The most challenging part of the transition to a hybrid monetization model is that tailoring a game for in-app purchases can be very different from building one that’s primarily ad-supported. This means that apps will have to adapt their engagement mechanics to ensure that both monetization methods work seamlessly.</p>
<p>“Games that tend to use a hybrid build don’t rely on friction to get users to pay but on higher value for users,” Sela explains. “So seasonal passes, for instance, are a very trendy item right now. This is something that can help convert a user into a paying user, and in return, they get more enjoyment from the game without friction. It helps users progress in a way that isn’t exactly a pay-to-win format, but it enhances the fun.”</p>
<h3>User spending habits in mobile games</h3>
<p>While in-app purchases are an essential part of game monetization, only a small percentage of users make them. A <a href="https://unity.com/resources/mobile-growth-monetization-report-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 report from Unity</a> found that only 1.83% of mobile gamers spend money on in-app purchases, and of these, only 28.81% are likely to spend again after the initial payment.</p>
<p>Seow states that, with the exception of games like Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail, where an entire meta is built around in-app purchases and their value, for most games, it’s a small minority of users that are making consistent in-app purchases.</p>
<p>For the majority of mobile gamers, their relationship with the industry is very casual, used as a way to entertain themselves and relieve boredom. This means that most players don’t feel inclined to spend money.</p>
<p>This is widely accepted by publishers who rely on in-app purchases as their main revenue model. Their focus is, therefore, more on increasing the amount of money this super minority pays, with converting users into paying users as a secondary goal.</p>
<h2>The future of direct-to-consumer monetization</h2>
<p>While the number of people willing to spend money on mobile games is very low now, the percentage of people willing to make in-app purchases may increase in the future. Younger generations are currently willing to spend money on games like Fortnite and Roblox, where cosmetic items and battle passes are commonplace.</p>
<p>This could be aided by the rise of monetization methods such as direct-to-consumer stores, which sell in-app purchases to consumers from outside of the app—such as through the developer or publisher’s website. Such stores are already well established in some parts of the world, particularly in non-gaming apps, and are also becoming increasingly common in the mobile games industry.</p>
<p>These external stores are a win-win scenario. Consumers are usually offered much better deals when making purchases for their favorite apps this way, as the developer avoids the hefty commission fees levied on sales made directly through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
<p>However, that does pose an infrastructural question—if apps can generate revenue outside the confines of app stores, where does that leave Apple and Google? That issue has led to a number of fights over payments, stores, and commission fees throughout the last few years.</p>
<p>The most notable was the widely documented legal battle between <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/epic-games-and-apple-settle-long-running-legal-battle/492167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple and Fortnite developer Epic Games</a>. In 2021, Epic Games had its game removed from the App Store after it gave users a direct payment option. The disagreement was only settled in May this year, with the court ruling that Epic Games is permitted to include links to alternative payment methods.</p>
<h3>The role of AI in monetization strategies</h3>
<p>The AI boom will certainly impact monetization strategies in the future. However, generative AI has yet to make a real impact on them for now. </p>
<p>Sela says, “It still needs to be proven that we can rely on it. Right now, we’re using it more for ideation and areas of creativity rather than leaning on it technically or analytically.”</p>
<p>Seow agrees, adding that while it is used commonly for user acquisition work, with data science or analytical work, publishers don’t want to share their data at this stage. Therefore, until there is a data-safe, privacy-safe, and confidential way to share data with gen AI platforms, it remains unlikely that its use will drive monetization strategies in the near future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, despite near-term negative impacts, the shift towards header bidding could benefit monetization teams, as they would have more time to think creatively about new ways to monetize games.<br />2025 is likely to be a year of innovation for mobile game monetization, with publishers embracing new concepts and innovations to adapt to changes in the market.

<p class="is-style-body-md">September is here again, and we’re kicking off another NFL season. As football fans mull over their fantasy draft picks and place their opening bets, sportsbooks eying the American market will be aiming to maximize new signups, reactivate idle users, and drive more engagement from seasoned bettors on their platforms.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">To achieve their goals, marketers and developers will need a sophisticated programmatic strategy to drive steady performance throughout the season and take advantage of key game days. This means taking a smart approach to campaign spending and finding the right ad creative to drive engagement. It also means balancing promotions, offers, and incentives with other retention strategies.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As the sports betting field grows more consolidated and competitive, relying on tried-and-true tactics from two or three years ago—flashy signup bonuses and one-size-fits-all promotions—is no longer enough. To help sports betting apps attract new users and improve retention in 2025, we’ve put together a few innovative strategies proven to boost conversions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">1. Tap into FOMO<em>:</em> Offer Tailored, <em>Time-Limited Opportunities</em> in Your Ad Creative</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Users are flooded with ads promising sign-up bonuses at the start of a new season. Instead of relying on generic offers, opt for a tailored approach. Most sports bettors already know game schedules and top lineups. They also know the kinds of bets they’d like to place—they’re looking for a reason to bet with a specific platform. Speak to them with ads that showcase live, <em>time-limited bets tailored to their needs.</em></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For example, <a href="https://liftoff.cn/ru/blog/introducting-liftoff-exclusive-ad-formats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liftoff Product Ads</a> are ad experiences designed explicitly for gameday creatives. They list upcoming schedules, live betting odds, and eye-catching matchups. Users are prompted to engage when they see attractive time-limited bets or exclusive odds. These creatives can also be combined with an offer to maximize conversions.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As a bonus, you can use the ads to showcase your easy-to-use UI. Users who click through to install the app will already know what to expect, making their first bets frictionless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">2. Focus on Maximizing <em>Engagement </em>With Your UGC Campaigns</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Most top Sportsbooks run a variety of celebrity and influencer-led campaigns to build credibility and expand their audience. While reaching for big names is tempting, programmatic campaigns benefit more from finding the right influencer for your audience. Working with content creators with niche audiences that match high-engagement segments will often drive higher engagement and more ROI.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">To boost engagement, experiment with different formats. For example, we found that formats like a two-person skit work best for betting apps. They allow you to communicate your top features and differentiators in a relatable and absorbing way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="270" height="480" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/19ef2b67747fa06d1a29-2-1.gif" alt="Two person skits" class="wp-image-34556" style="width:400px"/></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Make sure to hit your top value props in the script, whether it’s betting during the game, the variety of sports you can access, or just how easy your app is to use. To maximize impact, combine it with an app walkthrough to showcase your UI.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">3. Improve Retention Rates With Daily Engagement Systems</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">While users are reliably active during major sporting events like the Super Bowl or the Champions League Final, drop-offs are common during and after the season. Many top DFS and sports betting apps keep users active through daily engagement systems.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Daily engagement systems provide users with daily or weekly tasks, rewards, and benefits. A good example is FanDuel’s Daily Shuffle. This daily engagement system enables users to build up a 5-leg parlay (which turns an initial <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=482a21e8193752b1&amp;q=stake&amp;si=AMgyJEvCiuN81CuVzBIsHJFq8TP0p0M48GaMFA7lkPA0xJ2n9LVLdJFgn8C6bOjCwBptohd7CUkBVjWHLWis1rfzzi6-ognEpg%3D%3D&amp;expnd=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW_Ob9mK2PAxWKT0EAHb-gMoAQyecJegQIFRAS">stake</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=482a21e8193752b1&amp;q=winnings&amp;si=AMgyJEtf_wwxVVftS7Kej8ZWRY4PEZ7KG-uEV2zXFqZ9PoSawhq1g2o2dWV71iaX1ya-82AU9Yqba_6OBjZpn_yLvrR78pK9SMzT67oYo0r08uSjEqjM6vE%3D&amp;expnd=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW_Ob9mK2PAxWKT0EAHb-gMoAQyecJegQIFRAT">winnings</a> from a previous bet into a greater amount) by selecting a random prop (bet) each day. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="558" height="1018" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35169" style="width:400px" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1.png 558w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1-164x300.png 164w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1-36x66.png 36w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1-300x547.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-8.06.53-AM-1-375x684.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The more legs the user builds up, the better the parlay and associated rewards, providing incentives to keep betting. Plus, the random prop element helps to keep things interesting, as users never know what they’ll be offered.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">In short, daily engagement systems motivate users to explore more of an app’s features. They’re a proven way to boost retention rates and improve LTV by creating a sense of progress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">4. Introduce Social Engagement Features to Keep Users Active</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Introducing social features to your app is a reliable way to elevate the user experience and improve engagement rates. Sportsbook social features typically come in one of two forms. Community-based features, such as social media feeds, foster a sense of connection among users by getting them to share their accomplishments and interact. Competitive features, such as leaderboards, drive engagement through rivalry and push users to compete with their friends.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">One popular and effective social engagement feature is betting groups. As the name suggests, these are groups that users create and/or join to share bets, discuss their strategies to win, and more. DraftKings, for example, encourages individual bettors to join groups with their friends and showcases promoted betting groups. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="473" height="1024" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-473x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35167" style="width:400px" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-139x300.jpg 139w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-710x1536.jpg 710w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-30x66.jpg 30w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-300x649.jpg 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-900x1948.jpg 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-564x1221.jpg 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups-375x812.jpg 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/betting_groups.jpg 924w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">In each group, individual members can view and “tail” each other&#8217;s wagers, encouraging them to make similar or competing bets. Some groups may start forming friendly rivalries as they try to outperform their team members, boosting engagement even further.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">5. Be Flexible With Ad Spend, and Diversify Your Ad Mix</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Finally, we recommend adhering to best practices when planning your ad spend, but always leave room to be flexible. We recommend increasing spend leading into the event and monitoring real-time performance to stay agile as costs fluctuate or returns spike. We also recommend reserving some of your budget for post-game retargeting. Retargeting often delivers better returns as ad spend from competitors drops off.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Most top sportsbooks diversify their channels to reach users across multiple touch points. We think it’s equally important to diversify your ad formats and content in programmatic campaigns. Justin Warshavksy, the Senior Manager of Growth Marketing at DraftKings, a leading daily fantasy sports app, recommends testing a variety of formats and content. “Our approach is all about diversity,” Warshavksy says in <a href="https://liftoff.io/mobile-heroes/hero/justin-warshavsky/">his Mobile Heroes interview</a>. “We run a healthy mix of display, video, dynamic, and interactive ads, which gives us the flexibility to meet users across different touchpoints and moments. We’ve also invested heavily in UGC and influencer content, which has been a major driver in keeping us connected with our core demographic.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">If you’re creating or marketing a mobile app—whether it’s a game, dating app, fitness tracker, finance tool, or shopping platform—understanding what drives user behavior is probably an ongoing challenge. Many apps have millions of users, but what drives them to an app, and which features keep them engaged? <a href="https://info.liftoff.io/app-refinery-schedule-demo">AppRefinery</a>, Liftoff’s new app intelligence platform, and GameRefinery, our industry-leading gaming insights platform, are designed to help app developers and marketers understand their audience.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">If you’re curious to learn more about what GameRefinery and AppRefinery offer, you’re in luck. Liftoff’s Head of Activations, Christie Crable, GameRefinery’s Chief Analyst, Kalle Heikkinen, and Liftoff’s Associate Manager of Creative Performance, Abi Hargreaves, recently took a deep dive into the platforms’ key features. Here’s a summary of what they said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Understanding the Motivational Framework and Archetypes</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Several years ago, GameRefinery combined extensive survey research with advanced data science and statistical modeling to develop the <a href="https://www.gamerefinery.com/gamerefinery-player-motivations-archetypes/">motivational driver framework</a>. This model organizes mobile players&#8217; motivations into 12 easy-to-understand drivers, each describing a root player motivation. Drivers include <em>competing against others</em>, which refers to fans of multiplayer, and <em>thinking and solving</em>, which resonates with players who enjoy puzzle games like Candy Crush Saga, and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="934" height="1024" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-934x1024.png" alt="Player Motivations" class="wp-image-35179" style="width:600px" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-934x1024.png 934w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-274x300.png 274w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-1401x1536.png 1401w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-60x66.png 60w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-300x329.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-900x986.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-1128x1236.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-564x618.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations-375x411.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/player_motivations.png 1541w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">GameRefinery built on their framework with player archetypes, eight player categories with distinct sets of motivational drivers. For example, <em>treasure hunters</em> prefer games that offer new areas to explore, <em>kings of the hill</em> crave intense competition, and <em>expressionists</em> love to show off their personalities through gameplay.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="645" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-1024x645.png" alt="GameRefinery Player Archetypes Liftoff" class="wp-image-33004" style="width:900px" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-1024x645.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-300x189.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-1536x967.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-72x45.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-900x567.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-1128x710.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-564x355.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff-375x236.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gamerefinery-player-archetypes-liftoff.png 1999w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md"> Game marketers can identify which features promote and better predict which updates will drive engagement by looking at which archetypes are attracted to their game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">A Motivational Framework and User Archetypes Developed for Consumer Apps</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">AppRefinery evolves GameRefinery’s Motivational Driver Framework by applying its methodology and understanding of audience motivations to consumer apps. Users across different verticals have diverse motivations for installing an app. AppRefinery’s updated framework pinpoints 14 unique drivers (see below). <br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="993" height="1024" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-993x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-34112" style="width:600px" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-993x1024.png 993w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-291x300.png 291w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-1490x1536.png 1490w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-64x66.png 64w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-300x309.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-900x928.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-1128x1163.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-564x581.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1-375x387.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B-Motivation-Wheel-20240828-135518-1.png 1581w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">To match motivations with user profiles, AppRefinery analysts have also developed a set of user archetypes. They work similarly to player archetypes. The<em> lifelong learner</em>, for example, are users who are always looking to learn new things from their apps. Their biggest motivational drivers are learning and self-improvement and new discoveries. They’re also passionate about achieving milestones, markers that help them keep track of the new things they’ve learned.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Tailoring Ad Creative to Tap Into User Motivations</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Advertisers with access to Liftoff Intelligence and the motivational driver frameworks can take advantage the system to level up their ad creative. Motivational drivers into can help you tailor your ad creative to attract high-value users that are more likely to engage consistently with your app or game.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For example, a mobile game that taps into motivations like completing milestones, excitement and thrill, and improving skills might test ad creatives that represent each. A character in danger who needs help generates excitement, while ads that highlight in-game UI and upgrade systems might appeal to users looking for skills improvement. Level selectors in an ad are an easy way to represent completing milestones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="262" height="466" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-AdIndex25-GIF3.gif" alt="Project Makeover" class="wp-image-34592"/></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center is-style-body-md"><em>Ads that showcase different options appeal to users who enjoy resource optimization</em></p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Similar logic applies to consumer apps. For instance, if your audience enjoys self-expression and customization, test ad creative that showcases users personalizing their profiles or choosing custom UI skins. By matching key motivations with your ad creatives, you’ll improve conversion rates, increase installs, and even impact down-funnel events by attracting high-value users.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As always, the team recommends looking at what your peers are doing on the platform for ideas about improving your app’s performance. Maybe they&#8217;ve been more successful with incorporating a more comprehensive range of motivational drivers. Often, there will be themes in their creatives that you could use as inspiration.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">An essential part of the ad experience is where and how your ad placement appears on the publisher app. After all, the publisher app is where you find your audience. Check out their app if you know which publishers your installs are coming from. See how the ads look and which ads you encounter. This will give you an idea of which ad placements are ideally placed, what audiences they attract, and how to tailor your ads for the channel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Developing Engaging Apps With User Motivations as a Guide</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">A great UA strategy is essential, but it&#8217;s just as important to retain and engage your existing users by introducing features that speak to their motivations. Many top apps stay successful by introducing features specifically designed to appeal to user motivations outside their core offering. Here are just two examples.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Instagram recently launched an achievements feature that rewards creators with badges for reaching specific milestones, such as publishing a large number of posts, stories, or reels. Social status and achieving milestones are two of the biggest motivational drivers for social media platforms, with many users seeking to drive as much engagement as possible through comments and likes.

<p class="is-style-body-md"><span style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">By adding badge</span>s to collect, Instagram’s developers are appealing to users who are motivated by collecting and gathering. The badges are also kept in a neat visual display similar to a digital album. Through their new feature, the platform has built a system that actively encourages users to keep posting, increasing content creation and driving the app’s overall engagement.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><br>As a match-3 puzzle title, Gardenscapes is traditionally all about single-player gameplay. Still, during their recent limited-time event, team leagues, players are encouraged to band together and compete against opposing teams. At the end of each event, the teams earn rewards based on their performance.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">By branching out from Gardenscapes’ core offering, the game has expanded its appeal to target social-focused motivational drivers like competing against others. Of course, to win, players must communicate with their teammates—an attractive experience for users who enjoy working with others.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-lg">In addition to the rewards, each team is also given a rank based on their performance during the event. Teams must keep improving their skills and winning matches to attain the best ranks. For users motivated by achieving milestones, this aspect of the event will encourage them to return to the game.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">In 2025, the competition for new users is fierce, and the quality of your ad creative can make or break your carefully optimized campaign. So what makes ad creatives successful? How can you match the right assets with the right ad formats? And, if you’re looking to scale at speed, which AI tools and workflows can expand your resources without sacrificing the quality of your ads?</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Liftoff’s Senior Manager of Creative Performance, Deanna Ulrich, recently joined a panel of experts from companies including TikTok and <a href="https://www.singular.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singular </a>to discuss what today’s top marketers are doing to drive success. You can watch the full webinar <a href="https://lp.singular.net/creative-optimization-2025-webinar?utm_campaign=15388549-2507-Creative-Optimization-Webinar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and check out the highlights below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Invest in Creative Research and Cross-Team Collaboration</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Plenty of factors underpin creative performance, from the strength of your data and targeting to the ad formats you choose, to where your ads are placed. With all this in mind, the panel shared some of their top tips on how to maximize your ROAS.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">You have many options for your ad creatives, and competitor analysis is a great place to start. Look at what types of creative competitors are running, how long their ads run for, and what impressions their ad campaigns pick up. Don’t limit yourself by focusing on direct competitors. Ads from adjacent industries—or even a completely different app vertical—can provide the inspiration you need for your next campaign.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Lisi Gardiner, product director at Singular, suggests weekly hands-on meetings where multiple teams watch different ad creatives: “I think that [regular syncs] are a really important part of the process, keeping in tune with the market and understanding what&#8217;s happening.”</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">An effective way to speed up the ideation process is to create open communication channels across your teams. This includes your monetization teams, creative design teams, and product managers, all of whom will have different ideas about new concepts and how to iterate.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">“We&#8217;ve learned that we really need to be approaching solutions with multiple perspectives,” says Liftoff’s Deanna Ulrich. “We&#8217;re really leaning into cross-functional performance pods. Instead of these siloed workflows, we need a holistic view of performance end-to-end.” </p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">At Liftoff, this brainstorming process involves four different teams. A creative strategy team translates campaign goals into testable value props, isolating specific assets or formats that need to be tested. This ensures Liftoff can produce high-quality content at scale with the assistance of AI tools. Liftoff’s Operations team provides more data-focused feedback loops, isolating inventory-focused ad management and flagging any opportunities. Finally, product teams ensure everything stays on track with constant testing and reporting so ads can be quickly iterated or scaled.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Unifying tools and simplifying reporting methods are also great ways to keep everyone on track since different departments often have their own ways of working. “Being able to automate the tracking and distribute those creative learnings efficiently keeps all of us informed,” Ulrich says. Ultimately, this all comes down to communication and teamwork.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Targeting the Right Audience With the Right Message</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Of course, it doesn’t matter how good your creative is if they don’t reach your target audience. With tools like Symphony Creative Studio, creative teams can easily adapt content for target audiences and localize assets as needed. Overall, it’s just important to know the personas of your target audiences and what prompts engagement. Consider the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Who are you targeting? </li>



<li>What are you going to do to engage them? </li>



<li>When will you target them? </li>



<li>Where is your audience spending their time, and how will that determine where you target them? </li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Phillip Levin, Creative Director at<a href="https://craftsmanplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CRAFTSMAN+</a>, says the first place to start is with research. Competitor analysis is also essential here, as it can help teams align on the user motivations of your target audiences and on the KPIs that measure success. This is where you can also put your first-party data to the test, as it can be used to carve out target personas and guide the creatives you’re developing.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">“You have to have a good understanding of the channels where you&#8217;re running [ads] and all the data that you have from [your channels] to be able to build relevant creatives that are targeting that audience,” adds Singular’s Lisi Gardiner.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">With your research sorted, it’s time to choose your ad formats. Of course, there’s plenty of research out there showing which ad formats can deliver the best ROAS, but you’ll also want to consider which ad formats your target audience responds to and the goals of your campaign. If you’re looking to grow installs, playable and interactive end cards are an effective way of driving conversions—since they give customers a taste of what to expect from your product.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Equally important is your messaging, which should be tailored to your audience segment and refined through repeated A/B testing. To avoid overwhelming audiences and to keep ads memorable, Levin likes to stick with one key message per ad.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">“I like to think of it like a song, where you might not remember all the lyrics of a song, but you might remember the chorus or just a couple of words here and there,” he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Finding Success With Creative Testing</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Brett Hastie, associate director of performance creative at <a href="https://tinuiti.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tinuiti</a>, highlights the many variables driving the testing process that require unique approaches specific to your clients’ or ad campaign’s requirements.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">At Tinuiti, creative testing is divided into performance buckets. Each bucket is tailored to specific campaign objectives that change from client to client. This allows the team to dig deeper into more granular ad components, such as messaging, brand messaging, and imagery. </p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">“When starting from a clear narrative, it&#8217;s easier to generate variations and be able to pressure test them in market,” Hastie says.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Testing matrices are also a great way to map what you want to test. The results can be used to refine a creative concept and answer specific performance questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">“So maybe we start with a static or an HTML banner to set the messaging. From there, we can create videos to show more of the product. Then we can pair winning videos with playable or interactive end cards to get people to interact with your product. And then maybe we can even sprinkle in a static for retargeting purposes, which can create a winning combination for us,” says Phillip Levin from CRAFTSMAN+.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Using AI to Improve Creative Strategy and Drive Better Performance&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">AI is here to stay, and new platforms are constantly emerging and evolving. AI-enabled technologies and platforms help advertisers engage quality users at scale by taking the guesswork out of campaign optimization. But with so many AI tools, which are especially effective at improving creative strategy and driving ad performance?</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Singular’s Lisi Gardiner points out that one of the biggest challenges is determining why AI tools are practical. They are excellent at optimizing campaigns and delivering the results you need at scale, but this level of scale can sometimes mean you’re left in the dark when it comes to breaking down. It’s hard to determine which specific campaign components have resulted in its success.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">That’s where tagging comes in, ensuring campaigns carry all the attribution data needed to understand installs and post-install events. “You also need to have your top funnel and your cost data from the network. [At Singular], we automatically tag all your creatives using AI, and then we can combine it with the data and the reporting we already have.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Platforms such as TikTok are also expanding to offer a broad range of AI tools for campaign optimization. Dina Kirsher, global product marketing manager of TikTok’s Symphony Creative Studio, says AI is great for localizing campaigns with dubbing and lip syncing across different languages and can also supercharge creative assets.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">This is where generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot can be used, the former for image generation and the latter for research and ideation. At CRAFTSMAN+, these generated assets are fine-tuned with audio enhancements, image resizing, and caption additions in traditional design programs such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Of course, QA processes are an important part of maintaining ad quality. “I know sometimes if you generate an image of a hand, for example, the number of fingers will be different.&nbsp; There are small details that will be off. So always QA your output,” Levin explains.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Examples of Winning Creatives&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Often, small, strategic edits to ad creative can make the biggest difference. TikTok’s Kirshner gives an example of a client who had a top-performing ad that was 27 seconds long. Kirshner worked with the client to reduce the ad to 14 seconds while adding a new text hook, emojis, and tweaking the font size. The latest version of the ad massively outperformed the original—and all it took was a few minor changes to what was already a successful ad.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Liftoff’s Deanna Ulrich has seen similar results by tweaking formats for a client in the sports betting category, where the creative was showing real-time games via an API and feed. “We usually see a higher performance in the interstitial format, but we tried this in the banner format. Banner can be an underperforming format, but when we introduced this, ITA jumped from 4% to 20%,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">On the topic of ad formats, Ulrich highlights another example showcasing the ROAS of more modular ad formats. Liftoff’s ad selector gives users more control over their ad experience, with carousels allowing them to swipe through multiple playables or videos to choose from, enhancing engagement.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">It’s important to remember that playables aren’t just useful for gaming apps. According to Levin, they’re also an excellent format for brands since they’re really effective at grabbing users’ attention. “It drives engagement, it creates a stronger connection to your brand because it allows users to interact with your brand before they download it or look at the product more closely,” he says.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">An example is an ad for McDonald’s where users swipe the bottom of their screen to move a burger bun from side to side and catch ingredients in a timed playable. Once the playable section ends, a video ad plays before finishing with an end card where the user can take an action.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">Mobile marketing has seen some exciting innovations in the past few years. Top mobile games and apps are redefining what we’ve come to expect from ad creatives—and the rest of the industry is taking note. To help you stay competitive in today’s market, <span style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Liftoff’s <a href="https://info.liftoff.io/2025-mobile-ad-creative-index" target="_blank">2025 Mobile Creative Ad Index</a> </span>takes an in-depth look at the creative trends attracting spend from vertical leaders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Top Apps Are Building Standout Interactive Ads</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As the battle for user attention heats up, more apps are investing in ad formats that maximize engagement. Interactive ads and UGC content, once “nice to have” luxuries, are now essential to scaling user acquisition campaigns. For non-gaming apps in particular, interactive concepts now play a crucial role in driving conversions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35121" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-1-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Share of spend on interactive ads for top non-gaming apps grew 20% in 2024. This is a dramatic increase in share of spend compared to 2023, when top spenders allocated less of their ad spend on interactive ads than the rest of the field.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">So how do you make the most of your interactive ad spend? While tried-and-true templates like scratch-offs can increase engagement rates, we recommend adding an eye-catching feature that stops the scroll to see more impact from your interactive ads.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="238" height="427" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI2Dto3D-1.gif" alt="2D to 3D" class="wp-image-34607"/></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For example, while a standard, 2D carousel ad may get lost in the shuffle, adding 3D design elements can catch the eye of prospective audiences. The same logic can be applied to other popular ad formats. For instance, swapping out the static elements of social scroller with video content can drive increased engagement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Top Games Are Investing in Playable Ads and an Active Live Event Calendar</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">For mobile games, playable ad experiences should be table stakes. But for many games, game demos and minigames are still surprisingly underleveraged. We found that top-spending apps allocate over 35% more of their spend on playables than other apps, indicating that other games are leaving performance gains on the table. </p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Significantly, when looking only at non-top-spending apps, ITI conversion rates for playable ads are 16x that of non-playable formats. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-1024x768.png" alt="ITI non-top-spending games" class="wp-image-34585" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-4-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">To take a playable from good to great, combine it with a limited-time event promotion. Top-performing mobile games are finding consistent success by highlighting live event offerings in their UA campaigns. By showcasing time-limited live events in their ad creatives, they are able to tap into player FOMO, motivating new players to download the game or returning players to reactivate. For more on how top games hack the live event calendar, check out a <a href="https://liftoff.io/blog/hero-wars-live-events-gamerefinery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">case study about Nexters&#8217; Hero Wars</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Combine UGC With an App Walkthrough or App UI</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">It’s no secret why user-generated content (UGC) works. UGC ads are highly effective because content creators appear more trustworthy, and authenticity pays dividends. We found that UGC’s share of spend for top apps increased by 11% for top-spending apps, compared to 2% for other advertisers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-1024x768.png" alt="Share of spend on UGC" class="wp-image-34583" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B-Report-MobileAdIndex25-Graph-2-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">We also found that, on average, advertisers who introduce UGC to a campaign increase their impression-to-install (ITI) conversion rates by an average of 152%.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">When it comes to content, a good place to start is a walkthrough. No matter what kind of app users download, they will appreciate an initial experience guided by someone they trust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="270" height="480" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/35bd09b74c4a957d6e3a-1-1-1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-34557"/></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As a bonus, showing off your app UI before they install gives your audience a head start in the onboarding process. Critically, ensure that your assets are of the highest possible quality. After combining winning creative templates with a top asset, we’ve noted a 350% increase in scale (of ad spend).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Scale and Enhance Ad Creatives With Generative AI</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">If you’re looking to scale ad creative or test new concepts, you can unlock immense value with the right generative AI tools:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One of the most common ways AI can help is by enhancing existing assets at scale. For example, an AI tool can add gentle motion to your static assets, turning previously flat visuals into attention-grabbing showstoppers.</li>



<li>For video-to-playable ads, you can use AI tools to produce and test variations on top assets. You can create longer, more customized ad experiences by recombining existing assets in alternative sequences.</li>



<li>When it comes to user-generated content, generative AI can help overcome one of its biggest challenges: language barriers. You can use AI to localize ads for any geo with translation, dubbing, and lip syncing all in one edit, while even preserving the actor’s original voice.</li>
</ul>

<p class="is-style-body-md">The mobile games market has experienced its share of triumphs and challenges in the past few years. A record number of games crossed the billion-dollar revenue mark, but total mobile game downloads dropped to their lowest level since 2019. It’s a tricky time for mobile marketers and developers alike, and success in this rapidly evolving market requires constant innovation.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The <a href="https://info.liftoff.io/2025-casual-gaming-apps-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liftoff 2025 Casual Gaming Report</a>, created in partnership with <a href="https://www.singular.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singular</a>, explores the key benchmarks and changes to the casual game market from the past year and offers actionable insights from <a href="https://www.gamerefinery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameRefinery</a> to help you scale your game. </p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Here are a few highlights from the report that app and mobile game marketers need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Engagement, Cost, and Revenue Trends for Casual Games</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Where can casual game marketers see the most impact from their ad spend in 2025? The Casual Gaming Apps report examines several key benchmarks, including Installs Per Mille (IPM), Costs Per Install (CPI), and Return On Ad Spend (ROAS), as places to start. We noted the following from the report:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">1. Installs Per Mille (IPM) averages are higher on Android</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Installs per mille (IPM) are driven by several factors, including ad creative, strategy, and app store optimization. Across all genres researched, IPM is considerably higher on Android than iOS. Unsurprisingly, casual games (including hypercasual titles) that appeal to a broader audience consistently have a higher IPM than genres like casino and RPG.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">2. iOS acquisition costs are higher than Android</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-1024x768.png" alt="CPI by genre by platform" class="wp-image-34327" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-3@2x-1-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">User acquisition costs are on the rise for mobile games across the board. iOS continues to post higher costs per install (CPI) than Android. Simulation, action, and racing games see approximately 10x higher CPIs on iOS.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">3. But iOS delivers higher average Day-30 ROAS</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Although acquisition costs are higher on iOS, iOS users tend to spend more time on average on their phones, make more purchases, and have a higher median income than Android users. As a result, they continue to offer better average return on ad spend (ROAS). For casual games, average D30 ROAS in 2024 reached 47% on iOS compared to 15% on Android, an impressive gap. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-1024x768.png" alt="D30 ROAS by genre by platform" class="wp-image-34324" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Singular-Graph-4@2x-1-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Split by genre, sports games see the highest D30 ROAS on iOS at 80%, followed by kids at 68% and strategy at 60%. Comparatively, on Android, sports returns sit at 21%, with kids at 8% and strategy at 27%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Where Are Casual Game Installs Coming From?</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Capturing a new audience is an ongoing challenge for mobile game growth. As the market for non-gaming apps continues to grow, buying ad inventory in consumer apps can do a lot to future-proof your mobile game. Using data from GameRefinery, the report examines which game and app genres drive the most casual game downloads.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">1. Hypercasual games remain the top source for casual game installs</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Roughly half of all new player downloads for casual games come from advertisements shown in hypercasual and puzzle games. This is likely due to the high number of these games and their broad appeal. Hypercasual games also rely heavily on in-app advertising for monetization, meaning players simply expect and are exposed to more ads.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-1024x768.png" alt="Source apps for casual games, by game publisher" class="wp-image-34273" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph1@2x-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Of course, depending on the genre of your game, different strategies can yield better results. Beyond aiming for mass appeal, like also works for like. For example, Simulation games source new players from other simulation games in addition to hypercasual and puzzle titles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">2. Casual games find new audiences in non-gaming apps</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">‘Gaming works for gaming’ is a tried and true approach, but top games are also reaching audiences outside the mobile gaming ecosystem. Liftoff has found that over half of casual game installs from non-gaming publishers come from utility/productivity and entertainment apps. Social media and photo/video apps also comprise 25% of installs sourced from non-gaming apps</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-1024x768.png" alt="Casual game source apps by app categories" class="wp-image-34277" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graph3@2x-1-375x281.png 375w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">While audience overlaps can be harder to find initially, investing in ads in non-gaming apps is an excellent method of putting your game in front of net new audiences. Of course, working with the right DSP with access to non-gaming inventory will help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md"><strong>Noteworthy User Acquisition Trends from 2024</strong></h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Keeping abreast of engagement and UA trends in mobile games is essential to scaling new titles and growing veteran winners. Innovations keep the industry fresh, whether it’s new twists on live ops, minigames, or venturing into hybrid genres. 2024 saw many exciting new trends, but the experts at GameRefinery think these are a few to watch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Hypercasual and hybrid puzzles continue to capture audience attention</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">There has been a significant increase in the combined market share of hypercasual and other puzzle games in the US iOS top-grossing 500. These genres grew substantially, from $4.12 million in the last quarter of 2023 to $13.99 million in 2024.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-1024x768.png" alt="Hypercasual and puzzle trends" class="wp-image-34279" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1-375x281.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hypercasual_puzzle_1.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Following the success of titles like <em>Twisted Tangle </em>and <em>Hexa Sort</em>, many new games with simple yet addictive puzzle gameplay have emerged, often with unique twists to help them stand out. This seems to work, with several titles successfully entering and maintaining strong rankings in the top-grossing charts.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">These games benefit from straightforward gameplay without complex features, keeping players engaged with simple live events. They also appeal to a broad audience and do not require a significant time commitment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Live events are growing in popularity</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Live events have become increasingly popular and are crucial in keeping players engaged and willing to make in-app purchases. Last year, event trends like collectable albums, co-op missions, minigames, and win-streak events experienced significant growth. Social live events have also shifted from guild-based activities to shorter, more accessible co-op missions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-1024x768.png" alt="Key event trends" class="wp-image-34281" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1-375x281.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key_event_trends_1.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Different types of live ops can be leveraged to appeal to various audiences, with successful titles using several kinds of events, sometimes simultaneously. Minigame events, for example, encourage player investment in the core gameplay loop, extend gameplay variety, and make reward distributions more engaging. On the other hand, win streaks encourage players to spend more and engage consistently to strive to beat out other users.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">These events help keep gameplay fresh for players, provide new content to engage with, and help app developers monetize their games.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Innovations in Casual Game Monetization</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">As the mobile games market continues to evolve, so do monetization techniques. We’ve seen a number of new techniques and strategies boost revenue potential and enhance the player experience throughout 2024 and into 2025. The top ones include: </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Audio ads take off</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Audio ads offer a less intrusive way to advertise in games. Instead of interrupting gameplay with visuals, players listen to ads while continuing to play. This keeps users engaged and avoids disrupting their experience, making them more likely to continue interacting with the game.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="http://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-1024x768.png" alt="Audio ads" class="wp-image-34291" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-300x225.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-72x54.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-900x675.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-1128x846.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-564x423.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1-375x281.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Innovations_IAP_1.png 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Pocket Land is a good example of audio ads being used well. Players are notified before an audio ad begins. They must turn up the volume to get rewards. The game isn&#8217;t paused or covered by the ad. This approach to monetization can create a pleasurably nostalgic, radio-like feel for players.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Players make the most of temporary ‘remove ad’ offers</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Temporary ‘remove ad’ offers allow players to disable ads for a specific duration using in-game currency earned through gameplay or purchased. This can provide more flexibility and accessibility than traditional ad removal, which typically requires real money to be spent.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">The feature also encourages players to engage with the gameplay loop to earn enough currency to remove ads—it may even encourage them to seek permanent paid ad removal in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Customizable IAP bundles</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Customizable in-app purchase (IAP) bundles, which let players choose the items they want, are becoming more popular in casual games after gaining favor in midcore titles. While traditionally popularized by more complex games with larger economies, the appeal lies in giving players control over their spending.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">There are several different types of customizable bundles. Partially customizable bundles allow players to choose items within a fixed structure. In contrast, fully customizable bundle options enable players to pick items at a fixed or adjustable price. Some more engaging variations even use a randomized selection process, adding an element of surprise before players make their choices.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The &#8220;pick-one&#8221; bundle also gained significant traction in 2024. Players are typically presented with several different bundles at varying price points, often with a discount offered for users who buy all of them together.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md"><a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/game/587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b/overview">Hero Wars</a> is a popular RPG game that launched in 2016 to steady success. Since 2019, Hero Wars has <strong>consistently held a top 100 grossing position on US iOS</strong>, a testament to its exceptional long-term success in the market.<br><br>As a mature mobile game, Hero Wars achieved its success through a dynamic and expanding live event strategy, continuous iteration on core features, and the introduction of diverse monetization events and strategic collaborations to keep players engaged and spending.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-1024x669.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35047" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-1024x669.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-300x196.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-1536x1003.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-72x47.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-900x588.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-1128x737.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-564x368.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance-375x245.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Performance.png 1834w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Although Hero Wars is technically a mature game, the developers have found a way to increase revenue and DAU over successive periods. For example, we can see a spike in DAU from August 2024 to June 2025, making it a game we can learn from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="692" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-1024x692.png" alt="" class="wp-image-35048" style="width:1128px;height:auto" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-1024x692.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-300x203.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-1536x1038.png 1536w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-72x49.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-900x608.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-1128x762.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-564x381.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy-375x253.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Alliance-Fantasy.png 1796w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Hacking the Live Event Calendar for Growth</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">A key strategic initiative behind the success of Hero Wars is the expansion of its live event calendar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="636" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-1024x636.png" alt="Hero Wars Events Per Day" class="wp-image-35045" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-1024x636.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-300x186.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-72x45.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-900x559.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-1128x701.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-564x350.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day-375x233.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Events-Per-Day.png 1198w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Looking closely, we see that the overall event calendar expanded across various categories, but the key driver of growth is a significant increase in monetization-focused events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="632" src="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-1024x632.png" alt="Hero Wars Monetization Events" class="wp-image-35046" srcset="https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-1024x632.png 1024w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-300x185.png 300w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-72x44.png 72w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-900x555.png 900w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-1128x696.png 1128w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-564x348.png 564w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events-375x231.png 375w, https://liftoff.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hero-Wars-Monetization-Events.png 1196w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-body-md">The Monetization category in the Live Events Calendar also lists many more different IAP bundles and offers for players to purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">Battle Pass Feature Is a Top Revenue Driver</h2>



<p class="is-style-body-md">In particular, the Battle Pass feature has been crucial for Hero Wars. Battle Pass is a season-based monetization mechanic in which players can obtain rewards by progressing through different thresholds in the plan. They proved particularly effective during the event&#8217;s concluding days, driving revenue spikes as players strived to reap final rewards.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">The game&#8217;s Battle Pass feature has also evolved through three iterations<strong> </strong>(<a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1745787600000&amp;dateTo=1748465999999&amp;feedDateFrom=1714510800000&amp;feedDateTo=1748379599999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_1_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fad63f651c500a9755fee&amp;m_liveEventId=6548a718f8d2d121fa5e1122&amp;m_tab=Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero&#8217;s Way</a>, <a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1745787600000&amp;dateTo=1748465999999&amp;feedDateFrom=1714510800000&amp;feedDateTo=1748379599999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_1_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fad63f651c500a9755fee&amp;m_liveEventId=664291bec9c8062e67e3c911&amp;m_tab=Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero&#8217;s Way 2.0</a> &amp; <a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1745787600000&amp;dateTo=1748465999999&amp;feedDateFrom=1714510800000&amp;feedDateTo=1748379599999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_1_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fad63f651c500a9755fee&amp;m_liveEventId=66fd0a0e67f68602454e8784&amp;m_tab=Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero&#8217;s Way 3.0</a>), underscoring the critical role of continuous improvement.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">Finally, Hero Wars expanded its Battle Pass offerings in September 2024 by introducing the &#8216;<a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CanalystReview%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1743199200000&amp;dateTo=1748465999999&amp;feedDateFrom=1748293200000&amp;feedDateTo=1748465999999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;liveEventTags=634fad63f651c500a9755fee&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_1_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;shotModalIso=us&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634fad63f651c500a9755fee&amp;m_liveEventId=66d75e0bcefe4b66c3dbf9ea&amp;m_tab=Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season Pass</a>’ alongside Hero&#8217;s Way 3.0.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">From Lara Croft to Titan Power: Hero Wars&#8217;s Expanding Event Horizon</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">The collaboration with Lara Croft in May 2024</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">IP collaborations are increasingly popular within the gaming industry, making thematic cohesion even more crucial. Strategic partnerships with recognizable IPs can help build structured events and streamline content delivery. This, in turn, can lead to significant reductions in player acquisition costs.<br><strong><br></strong>In May 2024, Hero Wars brought its first-ever collaboration event featuring the famous adventurer <a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games/gameupdate/587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b/1.200.002/us/screenshots/66bc7322dd8bd204a528aff9,66bc7322dd8bd204a528afe6,66bc7322dd8bd204a528afe4?shotModalIso=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft</a>.

Played in permanent PVP mode, the event lets the players build teams with a draft mechanic to battle against other players&#8217; teams. Winners rise in the ranking and receive rewards.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">In the event, each player chooses a team of five heroes to combat against other players&#8217; teams in fully automated mode. Players need Draft Coins to compete, and these restore up to five coins automatically. You can also use Emeralds (Premium currency) to buy more.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">You choose two teams: one for defense and one for offense. The teams will be made with a draft mechanic, where you have three choices of Heroes, and you need to pick one of the three. This will be done five times for each team until both teams have five. You and your opponent choose at the same time a defense team, then an attacking team. Your attacking team will battle against the opponent&#8217;s defense team, and vice versa.<br></p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">Winning your battle will add to your win streak, and you will be rewarded once per day. Each players gets one Win Streak Shield to save their win streak from resetting in the case of a loss—but you can also acquire up to three daily with Emeralds (premium currency). Naturally, the more points from each victory, the higher the streak.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-title-md">The Tournament of Titan Power!</h3>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Hero Wars has long featured a Tournament of Power, which focuses on leveling up your Heroes. But for the first time in October 2024, players could compete by leveling up their Titans in <a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/feed?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1747083600000&amp;dateTo=1748379599999&amp;feedDateFrom=1714510800000&amp;feedDateTo=1748379599999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;liveEventAppearances=New&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_7_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=634faf2af651c500a9755ff1&amp;m_liveEventId=66fe95da67f68602454e8b7d&amp;m_tab=Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tournament of Titan Power</a>. The first solo tournament focused on Titans, it also contributes to the increase in the number of events on the Hero Wars calendar.<br><br>For newcomers to the game, Titans are another form of characters, such as Heroes, generally obtained through PVE mode by getting shards or from Gachas. Titans differ from the Heroes as they are locked behind Guild mechanics, meaning they are only available if you&#8217;re in a guild, and if you happen to transfer or leave a guild, the Titans remain locked until you join a new guild. Players attempting to access this feature prior to joining a guild are directed to the guild application portal.</p>

<p class="is-style-body-md">Getting points in the tournament is simple: you have to upgrade the power levels of your titan characters, and your tournament score equals the power increase of all your titans.

It&#8217;s a daily event where the player aims to get to the top of the tower by defeating enemy teams, collecting buffs, and opening chests.</p>



<p class="is-style-body-md">Let’s talk about the changes to the previous version of <a href="https://app.gamerefinery.com/live-events-tracker/games?additionalDatas=gameVersion%2CtopIAPs%2CrevenueChange%2CdownloadChange%2CauChange%2CanalystReview%2CaverageRevenuePerDailyActiveUser&amp;dateFrom=1747170000000&amp;dateTo=1748465999999&amp;feedDateFrom=1748293200000&amp;feedDateTo=1748465999999&amp;gameIds=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;performanceChangesBy=Peak_1_days&amp;performanceEffectThreshold=0.05&amp;shotModalIso=us&amp;sortGamesBy=SustainedGrossingRank&amp;modalType=liveEvent&amp;m_trackedGameId=587e85dcbc85fa43c6a8888b&amp;m_liveEventTypeId=63c54a4d25b67100af5aa371&amp;m_liveEventId=6531311cc7a27e2556b5809f&amp;m_tab=Description">Tower</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Before, there were three level types: one with chests, one with buff altars, and one where the player fights. Now, there are just three types of floors: Relic Floors, Treasure Floors, and a final, Boss Floor. This simplifies the floor types and streamlines the experience.</li>



<li>Before, by winning battles, the player earned Skulls, which can be used to get different buffs at the altar levels. Now, winning battles allows you to choose one out of three Relics. This is a clearer buff and relic system. Relics are chosen after winning battles, making them more immediate.</li>



<li>The energy and health levels of the heroes used to not reset between battles. Now, the energy and health levels of the heroes reset between each Relic Floor. This is a major gameplay change, making each Relic Floor a fresh start for heroes.</li>



<li><em>In the previous version, chests gained from levels contain gold, Tower coins, or random item fragments</em>. Tower 2.0 has &#8220;Treasure Floors&#8221; with three chests. The first is free, and the next two cost &#8220;Emeralds&#8221; (premium currency). One of the chests contains gold, another Tower coins, and the third one contains fragments. This offers a more strategic, potentially more rewarding experience while providing a clear monetization avenue for the game.</li>



<li><em>In Tower, points reward the player with Tower coins and gold at the end of the day. In Tower 2.0, g</em>old is directly earned by winning Battles or Chests.&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>In the previous version, gold from chests increases by 10% after three chests and 40% after 15 chests and with VIP level. </em>Now, you get 25% more gold if your VIP Level is 6. The tiered increase based on the number of chests is removed.<br></li>
</ul>



<p class="is-style-body-md"><strong>Summary</strong><br>Hero Wars has consistently ranked among the top 100 grossing games on US iOS since 2019, <strong>demonstrating remarkable long-term success</strong>. A key factor in its sustained success is the increased number of live events, especially monetization-focused events and staying on top of the latest trends.<br><br>The highlights we covered here were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lara Croft Collaboration (May 2024): This was the game&#8217;s first collaboration event, featuring a &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; themed adventure, solo missions, and various IAP bundles. A pre-order bundle for Lara Croft significantly boosted revenue on its last day.</li>



<li>Legends Draft (August 2024): A permanent PvP mode where players draft teams of heroes to battle others for rankings and rewards, while introducing options to use premium currency. </li>



<li>The Tournament of Titan Power (October 2024): A new solo tournament focusing on leveling up Titans, a separate character type “linked” to guild mechanics.</li>



<li>Seer&#8217;s Game (March 2025): A new monetization event based on a Russian roulette-style card drawing game, offering rewards and requiring &#8220;Seer&#8217;s Orbs&#8221; to participate.</li>



<li>Tower 2.0 Revamp (January 2025): A permanent PvE mode that was significantly revamped, streamlining floor types, altering the relic/buff system, resetting hero health and energy between certain floors, and a direct gold reward from battles.</li>
</ul>
